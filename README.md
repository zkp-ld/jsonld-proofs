# jsonld-proofs

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This library enables the attachment of experimental version of BBS+ signatures to JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials with Data Integrity.
It allows for the combination of multiple Verifiable Credentials and provides the capability to selectively disclose specific parts, resulting in the generation of a Verifiable Presentation.
Note that this is still in an experimental phase and is not suitable for practical use.
